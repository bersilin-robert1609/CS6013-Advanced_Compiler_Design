### Basics of Parsing and CFGs

#### Problem Statement

The problem statement and solutions are given in the file `cs20b013_A0.pdf` in the directory `A0`. It contains some simple problems for related to DFAs and regular expressions and CFGs. It also contains a question to build a top-down predictive parser for a given grammar. We first rewrite the grammar to remove ambiguity and also remove left recursion and then calculate the FIRST and FOLLOW for the grammar and generate the parsing table.
